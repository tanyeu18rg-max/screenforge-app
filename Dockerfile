# ScreenTinker server image: serves the dashboard, the web player, and the
# device API. All mutable state (db, uploads, jwt secret) lives under /data so it
# survives container restarts - mount a volume there. A built ScreenTinker.apk
# can be mounted at /data/ScreenTinker.apk to enable OTA APK downloads.
#
# No TLS in the image: it listens on plain HTTP :3001. Front it with a
# TLS-terminating reverse proxy / Cloudflare in production.

# --- builder: install production deps (better-sqlite3 is the only native one left; image
# decoding is pure JS + WASM since sharp was dropped, and sharp is now a devDependency that
# --omit=dev leaves out entirely) ---

# (server/lib/release-notes.js). Missing here, the API answers `current: null` and the "what's new"
# panel is empty on every containerised install — while the unit tests pass, because they read the
# file out of the source tree. Found on alpha, on the release that introduced the panel.

# ⚠️ AND THE CERTIFIED HARDWARE DATA, read from the repo ROOT at runtime by lib/certified-hardware.js.
# The SAME bug as release-notes.json above, missed when this file was added — and worse, because it
# fails INVISIBLY: routes/certified-hardware.js catches the ENOENT and serves the committed static
# page, which looks completely correct. What it silently drops is every approved community submission,
# since those are merged in at render time. So on every containerised install — which is the
# documented self-hosting path — the approve link in the email worked, the row went to 'approved',
# and the report never appeared. Found by submitting one on alpha and watching it not show up.
