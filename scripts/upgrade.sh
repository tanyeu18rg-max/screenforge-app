# upgrade — it takes effect one release later — unless an operator keeps a corrected copy outside the

# Back up the db first. This copy is the ONLY way back from a bad upgrade, so it is taken with a
# method that finishes, and it is verified before anything is changed.
#
# ⚠️ NOT `.backup`. The sqlite3 shell copies every page in ONE step while holding a read lock, so a
# single write from the running server aborts it with SQLITE_BUSY and it begins again at page one.
# On a busy database that never converges. Observed on production 2026-09-26: a 1.4 GB database with
# 33 displays heartbeating, sqlite3 at 94% CPU for over eight minutes with the destination frozen at
# 1227 MB. There is no error and no progress output, so the upgrade simply appears to hang — which
# is the worst way for a backup to fail, because the obvious response is to kill it and skip it.
#
# ⚠️ AND IT FAILS BY LOAD, NOT BY SIZE, so it passes every quiet-hour test. The nightly backup of
# that same database at 03:00 finishes in about 80 seconds. The upgrade you run at lunchtime does
# not finish at all.
