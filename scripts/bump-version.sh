#
# ⚠️ THE APPSTORE REFUSES build_number 0. The valid range is 1..2^63-1, and `react-native
# build-vega` defaults to 0 when the flag is absent — which every build before this one was, so
# every .vpkg ever produced here was unsubmittable. Worse, the Appstore requires BOTH the version
# AND the build number to be greater than the previous submission, so an unset build number also
# means there is no way to upload a second version later.
#
# ⚠️ STAMPED AS A LITERAL, not computed in the npm script. `--build-number $(...)` would be shell
# interpolation inside package.json, which breaks on Windows (there is a windows-setup.bat in this
# repo) and makes the built artifact depend on the shell that launched it. A literal is
# reproducible and greppable, and it matches how every other version in this script is written.
#
# Derived from the version so it cannot go backwards while the version goes forwards:
# major*10000 + minor*100 + patch, i.e. 2.1.6 -> 20106. Two digits each for minor and patch is
# plenty for this project and keeps the number readable at a glance.
#
# ⚠️ A RE-SUBMISSION OF THE SAME VERSION NEEDS A HIGHER NUMBER BY HAND. If Amazon rejects a build
# and you fix it without bumping the version, pass a larger --build-number on the command line for
# that upload. This derivation deliberately does not track re-submissions: guessing at them would
# make the number unpredictable, and an unpredictable build number is how you lose track of which
# binary is live.

#    webos-player.test.js asserts that parity, which means the tagged commit failed its own test
#    suite and the release job never ran. A stamp that is not staged is worse than no stamp: the
#    working tree looks correct and only CI sees the truth.
#    The two js/app.js fallbacks are stamped at 4c-bis. They used to be left to build-ipk.sh /
#    build-wgt.sh, which run during the test suite - so the tagged commit carried a stale literal
#    and a test run dirtied the tree. v2.2.0 was tagged that way once before this was fixed.
