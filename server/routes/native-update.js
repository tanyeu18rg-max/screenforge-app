/*
 * Native player self-update — one factory, mounted twice (routes/pi-update.js, routes/win-update.js):
 *
 *   GET /api/<kind>/update/check?version=&device_id=[&forced=1]
 *     -> { update_available, latest_version, current_version, download_url, sha256, size, reason }
 *   GET /download/<kind>
 *     -> the newest package this instance holds (lib/package-cache.js instance)
 *
 * Both unauthenticated, exactly like /api/update/check and /download/apk: a player checks before
 * anyone may be signed in, and the bytes are the same public package the /download page offers.
 *
 * ⚠️ DELIBERATELY THE SAME RULES AS THE ANDROID CHECK, NOT A NEW SET. Every trap the APK path has
 * already paid for applies unchanged to a native player that updates itself on a timer:
 *   - the kill switches (config.otaEnabled, devices.ota_enabled = 0) are enforced HERE, server-side,
 *     so they cover every build that will ever exist, not only builds that remember to honour them;
 *   - otaBreaker.decide() — the phantom-version guard, the rate breaker and the #341 no-progress
 *     axis. A Pi whose dpkg refuses the package (or a PC whose installer fails) would otherwise
 *     download it every poll, forever;
 *   - the GLOBAL download admission guard (lib/ota-download-guard), shared with /download/apk on
 *     purpose: the thing it protects is this process's event loop and disk, and a Pi fleet, a Windows
 *     fleet and an Android fleet updating at once are one flood, not three.
 *
 * NOT here, by design: the beta channel. It exists for Android because a prerelease sorts below its
 * own release and a test build silently reverts; that needs a second artifact slot and a column
 * written from a GET (see replica-proxy WRITING_GETS). The native players have neither yet, so this
 * route writes nothing, and a tester on a prerelease is protected by the same superseded-prerelease /
 * client-newer answers that protect an Android tester who is not opted in.
 *
 * `anonymousLookup` (Windows only): see the comment at its branch below.

       * does. Before running an installer the helper asks THIS endpoint — on the server the ADMIN
       * configured, never one the user-level player names — what the sha256 of the current package
       * is, and refuses any file that does not match. The helper holds no device token and is not the
       * thing that polls for updates, so it calls with ?version= only.
       *
       * So a check without device_id is answered as a lookup, not as an update poll:
       *   - the sha256 and size of the hosted package are ALWAYS returned (once hashed) — they describe
       *     a public file anyone can download and hash, so there is nothing to withhold, and a helper
       *     verifying the very version it is about to install must not be told "up-to-date, no hash";
       *   - update_available is a plain version comparison;
       *   - otaBreaker.decide() is NOT consulted. Its rate state for a device-less call keys on the
       *     VERSION ('v:<version>'), so helper lookups would share — and could trip — one bucket with
       *     every other device-less caller on that version, and a tripped breaker would withhold the
       *     hash the helper needs to finish an install the player already downloaded. The breaker's
       *     job (stopping a device from re-downloading forever) belongs to the player's own poll,
       *     which always sends device_id and still goes through it below.
       * The download itself is still admitted by the global download guard like any other.
       * The Pi route does not enable this: the Pi player installs its own .deb through a root helper
       * it runs itself, and a device-less Pi check keeps the breaker's version-keyed behaviour.
