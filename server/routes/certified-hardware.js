 * Serve the Certified Hardware page: Kardinal Screens's committed entries plus approved community reports.

 * ⚠️ THIS PAGE MUST NEVER FAIL TO SERVE. Reseller agreements name its URL, so a database problem has
 * to degrade rather than error. The fallback is the committed static file, which holds Kardinal Screens's
 * own entries — exactly the half that carries contract weight. Losing community reports for a few
 * minutes costs nothing; returning a 500 from a URL named in a contract is a different matter.
 *
 * Rendered output is cached in process and dropped when a submission decision is made, so the usual
 * request does no database work at all.
