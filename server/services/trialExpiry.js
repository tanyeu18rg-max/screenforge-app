// Trial expiry: the nightly sweep that ends a lapsed trial, plus the two emails around it.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The trial-expiry check lives in getUserPlan() (middleware/subscription.js) and
// only runs when something calls it: the Billing page, pairing a device, uploading content, a
// device (re)connecting. Logging in and browsing the dashboard do not. So a user who signed up,
// tried it and went quiet stayed on Pro in the database indefinitely — on 2026-09-12 that was 283
// of 421 hosted accounts. Nothing else in the trial story works while that is true: no screen is
// ever blocked, no one is ever asked to pay, the countdown just vanishes from a page most users
// never open.
//
// WHAT RUNS, once a day at SWEEP_HOUR_UTC:
//   1. downgrade  — every lapsed trial is flipped to Free through the SAME expireTrial() helper the
//                   lazy path uses (one predicate, one writer). Each affected screen is then pushed
//                   its (now access-gated) playlist so an extra screen that is currently connected
//                   stops immediately instead of playing on until its next reconnect.
//   2. T-3 email  — "your Pro trial ends in N days", once per user, while ENDING_SOON_DAYS or fewer
//                   remain. What changes, what it costs to keep, reply-to-Dan.
//   3. expiry email — "your Pro trial has ended", once per user, after the downgrade. Which of their
//                   screens stopped, that nothing was deleted, how to bring the screens back.
//
// GATING.
//   - config.selfHosted (SELF_HOSTED=true): the whole service is OFF — nothing scheduled, the sweep
//     returns null. A self-host never bills, so there is nothing to enforce and no one to upsell.
//     (The lazy getUserPlan path is untouched by this file and behaves as it always has.)
//   - HOSTED_INSTANCE=true additionally gates the EMAILS (same rule as activationNudge: a bulk
//     sweep must never mail a self-hoster's user base by accident). The downgrade itself does not
//     need it.
//   - TRIAL_EXPIRED_EMAIL_MAX_AGE_DAYS (default 30): the expiry email only goes to trials that
//     ended within this window. The first sweep on hosted prod flips a months-deep backlog; a
//     "your trial ended" note four months late reads as broken, so the backlog older than the
//     window is downgraded silently. Raise the env var to reach further back on purpose.
//
// Idempotency: users.trial_ending_email_sent_at / trial_expired_email_sent_at, stamped after each
// send; each email goes to a user at most once. expireTrial() is a guarded UPDATE, so re-running the
// downgrade is a no-op. Opt-out: email_alerts = 0 excludes a user from both emails. Unverified
// addresses that never logged in are skipped too — a typo'd signup is not a lead.
//
// ⚠️ Every "now" comparison in SQL here uses CAST(strftime('%s','now') AS INTEGER). strftime
// returns TEXT and SQLite orders every INTEGER below every TEXT, so an un-cast comparison is
// silently always-true or always-false. See the note on findExpiredTrialUserIds.
