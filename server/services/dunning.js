/*
 * Dunning: what happens when a PAYING customer's payment fails.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Before it, a failed payment wrote `subscription_status = 'past_due'` and
 * nothing in the product ever read that column again — no email, no banner, no change in access.
 * The only real consequence in the whole system was `customer.subscription.deleted` eventually
 * dropping the account to Free, whenever Stripe gave up. So a customer whose card expired was told
 * nothing by us and kept everything, and a customer whose subscription quietly went `unpaid`
 * without that event kept a paid plan for ever.
 *
 * THE SHAPE, and the reasoning behind each part:
 *
 *   1. Tell them, immediately. The first failed invoice of an episode sends one email. A card
 *      failing is not a policy violation — it is usually an expired card, and the person wants to
 *      fix it. Being told is the entire remedy in most cases.
 *   2. Change nothing for GRACE_DAYS (7). Stripe is still retrying during this window; taking
 *      anything away while the payment may yet succeed would punish a customer who is not at
 *      fault, and would have to be undone.
 *   3. Then fall to Free, and say so. Not a suspension, not a deletion — the Free plan's limits,
 *      the same ones an expired trial gets, applied by the same mechanism.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE PLAYERS ARE NEVER TOUCHED BY ANY OF THIS. Nothing here blanks a screen, and nothing here
 * deletes anything. A shopfront going dark over a card problem is a far worse outcome than a
 * month of unpaid Pro, and it is the customer's END USERS who would see it. Screens beyond the
 * Free limit stop, exactly as they already do when a trial ends — that is the one shared,
 * predictable rule, not a new punishment invented here.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTHING IS IRREVERSIBLE. `stripe_subscription_id` is kept on a lapsed account so the
 * reconcile below can find it again the moment the customer fixes their card, and the email
 * stamps are cleared with the grace clock so a lapse next year is announced rather than
 * suppressed by a stale one.
 *
 * RECONCILE. Webhook delivery is not a guarantee — this instance lost `customer.subscription.*`
 * for months because the endpoint was never subscribed to them, and had no way to notice. So the
 * sweep also asks Stripe directly what it believes about every subscription we think we have, and
 * corrects the database. That is the part that makes the rest safe to rely on.
 *
 * GATING (identical to services/trialExpiry.js, deliberately):
 *   - SELF_HOSTED=true: the whole service is off. A self-host never bills.
 *   - HOSTED_INSTANCE=true additionally gates the EMAILS, so a bulk sweep can never mail a
 *     self-hoster's user base by accident. The downgrade and the reconcile do not need it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Every "now" comparison in SQL uses CAST(strftime('%s','now') AS INTEGER): strftime returns
 * TEXT and SQLite orders every INTEGER below every TEXT, so an un-cast comparison is silently
 * always-true or always-false.
