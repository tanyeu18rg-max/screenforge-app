 * nothing" is a recurring shape in this codebase and this module exists to end it.
 *
 * The player DECLARES its capabilities at registration, because only the player knows at runtime:
 * an Android device gains real screenshots when accessibility is switched on, and loses Tier-2
 * commands when it is not device owner. A static per-platform table could never know that.
 *
 * ⚠️ Legacy displays declare nothing. A fleet of several hundred is not going to update before the
 * next dashboard deploy, so an absent declaration falls back to a per-platform baseline rather
 * than to "supports nothing" — which would strip the UI for every existing display at once. The
 * baseline is deliberately optimistic for things that always worked, and pessimistic for anything

    // They stay out for a DIFFERENT and narrower reason: captureScreen() needs a node-enabled
