*How an automated client authenticates with this ScreenForge instance.*

**Audience:** AI agents, MCP clients and scripts acting on behalf of a ScreenForge user.

ScreenForge uses **scoped personal access tokens**. There is no OAuth flow, no client registration,
and no way for an agent to obtain a token on its own — a human creates one in the dashboard and gives
it to you. If you do not have one, stop here and ask for one.

## Registration

**There is no programmatic registration endpoint, and none is planned.** Do not look for one, and do
not treat a \`401\` as a prompt to go and find one.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Supported method | \`bearer\` — a long-lived token in the \`Authorization\` header |
| Provisioning surface | ${base}/app#/settings (human, signed in) |
| OAuth authorization server | none — this resource does not delegate authentication |
| Credential format | opaque string beginning \`st_\` |
| Credential lifetime | until revoked in the dashboard |

⚠️ An agent that cannot present a token cannot obtain access by any other route here. The correct
behaviour is to stop and ask the person you are working for, naming this page.

## Presenting a token

    Authorization: Bearer st_...

Tokens begin with \`st_\`. The API description is at ${base}/openapi.yaml and the
rendered reference at ${base}/docs.

## What a token can do

A token is bound to **one workspace** and carries **one scope**:

| scope | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| \`read\` | GET only |
| \`write\` | GET plus create and update |
| \`full\` | the above plus delete |

## What a token can never do

A token authenticates as its owner but is forced to the lowest platform role, so it is **not** a way
to reach an administrative surface. These are unreachable with any token, by construction rather than
by a permission check: platform administration, authentication and account management, billing,
workspace and organisation management, and provisioning.

It also cannot cross a workspace boundary: the workspace is fixed when the token is created.

## Rate limits and failure

- \`401\` — missing, malformed, revoked, or a token presented to a surface tokens cannot reach.
- \`403\` — a valid token whose scope does not permit the method.

A \`401\` from an endpoint you believe you should reach is far more likely to mean "tokens cannot
reach this endpoint at all" than "your token is wrong". Retrying will not fix it.

## Getting a token

Sign in to the dashboard, open **Settings → API tokens**, create one, and copy it — the value is shown
once and stored only as a hash.

## Managing signage from an AI client

This instance runs a **Model Context Protocol server** at \`${base}/mcp\`. Point an MCP-capable client
at that URL with the same \`Authorization: Bearer st_...\` header and it gets a curated set of tools
rather than 133 raw endpoints. ⚠️ The tool list is filtered by the token's scope: a \`read\` token is
never shown a tool that writes.

## Self-hosted instances

ScreenForge is open source and commonly self-hosted, so this document describes **this** instance at
${base}. Another deployment may be a different version with a different set of endpoints; read its own
\`${base}/openapi.yaml\` rather than assuming ours.
