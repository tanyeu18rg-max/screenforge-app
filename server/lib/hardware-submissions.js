 * Reseller agreements define that term as the models published on the page, and support obligations
 * attach to them. Certification therefore stays in certified-hardware.json, committed by a human
 * who tested the device. Everything arriving here is published as community-reported, validated by
 * "Community", under a heading that says in writing it carries no support commitment.
 *
 * That is enforced HERE, not in the form. A form is a suggestion to a browser; anyone can post
 * whatever they like to the endpoint. So `status` and `validated_by` are assigned, never read from
 * the request, and no code path in this module can produce any other value.
