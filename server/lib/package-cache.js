/*
 * Resolve a native player's self-update package — the Raspberry Pi .deb (lib/deb-cache.js) and the
 * Windows installer (lib/win-cache.js) — for its /api/<x>/update/check and /download/<x> routes.
 *
 * One factory, two instances, because the two packages differ only in their filename and where an
 * operator may point the in-repo fallback. Everything below is the same rule for both:
 *
 * The same shape as lib/apk-cache.js and lib/ipk-cache.js: what is on disk is resolved once at boot
 * and refreshed on an interval, never with a per-request statSync — an update check is the one
 * endpoint a whole fleet hits on the same schedule.
 *
 * Two differences from those two, both forced by what these packages are:
 *
 *   1. THE VERSION COMES FROM THE FILENAME. The Pi build (native/packaging/linux, dpkg-deb) emits
 *      exactly `screenforge-pi_<ver>_all.deb`; the Windows build (Inno Setup) emits
 *      `Kardinal Screens-Setup-<ver>.exe`. So the file describes itself. There is no single well-known
 *      name to stat: a directory can hold several builds (the previous release left beside the new
 *      one), and the NEWEST by version wins — not the newest mtime, because a `cp -p` or a restore
 *      from backup scrambles mtimes and would silently serve a downgrade that the version comparison
 *      then refuses to install.
 *
 *   2. THE SHA-256 IS PART OF THE OFFER. Neither dpkg nor an .exe fetched over HTTP is verified by
 *      anything else, so the player (Pi) / the privileged helper service (Windows) checks the hash we
 *      advertise before installing. It is computed ONCE per (path, size, mtime) and cached — never per
 *      request — and computed with a stream so a 30-100 MB package cannot stall the event loop at boot
 *      (see the loop-spike notes).
 *      ⚠️ Until the hash exists the check endpoint must NOT offer the update: an offer without a
 *      checksum is an offer the device will download and then reject, which is exactly the
 *      "download loop" the OTA breaker exists to stop. `ready()` is the promise tests await.
 *
 * Search order, first directory holding ANY matching file wins (an operator mount always beats a
 * build that happens to be in the checkout):
 *   DATA_DIR/                    operator mount — wins
 *   <repo>/native/dist/          in-repo build output (the env override — PI_DIST_DIR / WIN_DIST_DIR —
 *                                replaces it; tests point it at an empty dir so a developer's local
 *                                build cannot change their result)
 *
 * The version part of each filename regex accepts Debian's `~` prerelease marker (1.2.0~beta1 sorts
 * BELOW 1.2.0 in dpkg, exactly as semver's `-beta1` does) and normalises it to `-` so ota-breaker's
 * comparator — the one every other OTA path uses — can order it. A Debian revision (`1.2.0-1`) parses
 * as a prerelease under semver, which would sort it BELOW 1.2.0; neither build emits revisions, and
 * this is called out in docs/pi-native-player.md rather than half-supported here.
