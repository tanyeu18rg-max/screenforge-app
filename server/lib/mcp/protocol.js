/*
 * Model Context Protocol, JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP.
 *
 * ⚠️ IMPLEMENTED DIRECTLY RATHER THAN WITH THE SDK, and the trade-off is worth stating. The official
 * SDK is ESM-first and this server is CommonJS, so taking it means either a dynamic-import dance in a
 * hot path or a build step this project does not otherwise have — against a protocol surface that is
 * four methods wide. We carry one fewer production dependency and keep the licence/SBOM story simple.
 * The cost is that a future protocol revision is our problem: PROTOCOL_VERSIONS below is the single
 * place that changes, and `initialize` echoes a version it recognises rather than asserting our own.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT implemented: resources, prompts, sampling, roots, and server-initiated streaming.
 * We have nothing to put in them. An empty capability advertised is a client feature that renders a
 * blank panel; a capability omitted is a client that never asks.
 */
