 * which is how #245 arrived: a menu that ignored the operator, a keyring prompt, X11 tools
 * no-oping on a Wayland Pi, and a banner spelling the product's own name wrong.
 *
 * These tests check the two things a repo can check without a Pi: that the generated script is
 * syntactically valid bash, and that the flags/guards the bug reports turned on are actually
 * present. `bash -n` on the OUTER script would not have caught any of it — the kiosk script lives
