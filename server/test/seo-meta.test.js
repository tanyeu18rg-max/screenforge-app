 * Every URL we advertise in sitemap.xml must be a real page with the metadata a crawler needs.
 *
 * This exists because nothing checked it. Bing found a "title too long" on a guide, three /legal/
 * pages were being crawled with no description at all, and the homepage description was long
 * enough to be truncated in results. All of that is measurable here in a second, and none of it
 * was. The alternative on offer was installing a third-party SEO skill, which encodes a
 * methodology but cannot fail a build.
 *
 * ⚠️ MEASURE THE RENDERED TEXT, NOT THE MARKUP. "&amp;" is five characters that display as one, and
 * counting raw HTML made the homepage title look like it was exactly on Bing's 70-character limit
 * when it renders at 66. Decode first or this test reports phantom failures.
