/* The /download index (lib/download-index.js) and the guides it is the other half of.
 *
 * The rule under test is not "does it render". It is that a row is only ever offered when this
 * instance actually has the bytes behind it. An operator sent to a 404 by their own dashboard
 * concludes the platform is unsupported and buys a different box — so "offered" and "present" must
 * be the same condition, and a missing artifact must still say something useful instead of
 * disappearing.
 *
 * The second half is the reason this page exists at all: the guides must not send anyone to a
 * GitHub release for a player. The BrightSign archive has the server URL stamped into its bytes, so
 * a release asset points a freshly imaged player at the wrong instance — a failure that presents as
 * a pairing bug. Asserted here rather than left to review, because a plausible-looking external
 * link is exactly the edit nobody questions.
