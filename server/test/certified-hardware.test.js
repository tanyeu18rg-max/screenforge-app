/* The Certified Hardware list (certified-hardware.json -> frontend/certified-hardware.html).
 *
 * ⚠️ WHY THIS FILE IS STRICTER THAN A NORMAL PAGE TEST. Reseller agreements define "Certified
 * Hardware" as the models published on this page, and support obligations attach to what appears
 * there. So the failure that matters is not a broken layout, it is a device quietly claiming a
 * status it has not earned: a "certified" row with no test date, a limitation with nothing
 * describing it, or a community report that reads as supported. Each of those is asserted below.
 *
 * The other half is freshness. The page is generated and committed, so a forgotten rebuild would
 * publish yesterday's list with today's data sitting in the repo looking correct. --check catches it.
