/**
 * The INBOUND half of device REST: a local control system asks this panel to do something, or asks
 * what it is doing. Goal B, part 3.
 *
 * Parts 1 and 2 point outward — the panel calls the PLC. This points inward: the PLC, the Crestron
 * processor or the Home Assistant box calls the panel. The two exist for the same reason and it is
 * not symmetry for its own sake: an AV control system on the customer's LAN cannot reach the
 * ScreenForge server (it is in another country, behind an outbound-only firewall, and frequently
 * has no credentials the installer is allowed to hold), but it can reach the screen in the same
 * rack. Today an installer's only option is to drive the dashboard, which means a browser, a login
 * and the WAN — three things a room-control system does not have.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTHING HERE TOUCHES A SOCKET, and nothing here performs a command. This is the DECISION half,
 * the same split TriggerResolve has from TriggerListeners, and for the same reason: the door that
 * reads bytes and the code that decides what they mean must be separable, or the only way to test
 * the decision is to open a port.
 *
 * ⚠️ OFF BY DEFAULT, AND ITS OWN FLAG. It shares the trigger HTTP port because it is the same door
 * on the same socket, but it is emphatically NOT the same permission: `accept_http` means "a LAN
 * host may put an overlay on this screen", while this means "a LAN host may change what this screen
 * is doing". One flag for both would mean every site that wanted triggers silently also got remote
 * control, and nobody would know until it was used.

     * "what is this caller entitled to ask".
     *
     * Who the caller is matters. A dashboard command carries a session or a `full` API token issued
     * by someone who can already see the whole fleet. This one carries a secret that will be typed
     * into a Crestron program, committed to a site's integration repo, mailed to a subcontractor and
     * left in place for the life of the building. It is a ROOM CONTROL credential, and the command
     * set is the one a room control system needs:
     *
     *   refresh                — reload the playlist ("the sign is stale, kick it")
     *   screen_on / screen_off — the actual reason this feature exists: the room's AV system turns
     *                            the display on with the projector and off when the room empties
     *   set_volume             — the audio system owns the room's volume, not the sign
     *   set_brightness         — per-window (Tier 0); house lights up, sign down
     *   set_system_brightness  — the same intent where the panel is device-owner (Tier 1)
     *
     * What is deliberately ABSENT, and why each one:
     *
     *   shell, install_apk     — code execution and software installation from a LAN credential.
     *                            No.
     *   set_server_url         — repoints the panel at another server. That is a complete takeover
     *                            of the screen from inside the LAN, and it is reversible only by
     *                            visiting the panel.
     *   update                 — pulls and installs an APK. Same class as install_apk.
     *   http_request           — would turn every panel into an open request relay for anything on
     *                            the segment. The caller is already on the LAN, so it is not new
     *                            REACH; what it is, is laundering — the request would arrive at the
     *                            PLC from the screen, with the screen's credentials, and the audit
     *                            trail would name the screen.
     *   launch                 — starts an arbitrary app on the panel.
     *   settings, kiosk_unlock — open the way OUT of kiosk mode, which is the thing kiosk mode is.
     *   set_time, set_timezone — a wrong clock breaks every schedule at once and the symptom points
     *                            at the schedule.
     *   set_power_schedule     — a definition, not a room action; it belongs to whoever owns the
     *                            site's operating hours, not to a wall panel.
     *   reboot, shutdown       — the one genuinely arguable exclusion. An integrator will ask for
     *                            it. It is out of v1 because every other command here is undone by
     *                            sending its opposite, and these are not: a reboot loop from a
     *                            stuck automation is a fleet on the floor, and a panel that is
     *                            rebooting is a panel that cannot be told to stop. Adding it later
     *                            is one line; taking it back is a fleet visit.
