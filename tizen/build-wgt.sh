# Samsung Apps TV Seller Office pre-test (2026-09-18) rejected the consumer submission on four
# counts, all one thing: config.xml is written for SSSP / B2B signage panels. On a consumer TV the
# B2B privileges are simply absent and device-control.js reports "unsupported" (README, #125), so
# the app runs identically without them — but the STORE refuses the manifest outright:
#   Background Support  background-support="enable" is partner-only
#   B2B API             developer.samsung.com/privilege/b2b*, serialport, ... not allowed
#   B2B API             systemcontrol, devicetimer, broadcast, ... are partner-level
#   B2B API             "wrong API version" — the same partner privileges vs required_version
# One manifest, two packages: the store build rewrites a COPY in the staging dir and never touches
# config.xml itself, so the SSSP build keeps its fleet-control surface.
